# Python String Replacement Example  

This is a basic Python example showing how to replace text in a string using the `.replace()` method.  

## What This Does  

The code demonstrates how to:  
- Take a string (`"Hi Thomas Jensen"`)  
- Replace part of it (`"Hi"`) with new text (`"bye"`)  
- Print the result  

## The Code  

```python
string = "Hi Thomas Jensen"
print(string.replace("Hi", "bye"))
When you run this, it will output:

bye Thomas Jensen
How It Works
string = "Hi Thomas Jensen" creates a text variable

.replace("Hi", "bye") finds "Hi" and changes it to "bye"

print() shows the modified text

Try It Yourself
Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., replace.py)

Run it with Python:

sh
python replace.py
Experiment by changing the text or replacement words!
